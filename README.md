# NCS Player

This app is a proof of concept Kivy video player. I hope to use it for my upcoming project "Vapaa Aani" But before I delve to deeply into the intricacies of a more complex player, I wanted to get the basic idea hashed out. This plays a collection of videos based on a list that is provided to it. 

Seeing as NCS is all about original content creators using their music with out having to worry about copy right claims, I figured they would be a fine candidate for me to hash out how this all works.
